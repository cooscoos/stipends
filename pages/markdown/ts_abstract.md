The graph below shows a time series, over the last decade, of the net annual income from:

- National Living Wage (NLW) work;
- Real Living Wage (RLW) work, and;
- UKRI's minimum stipend;

after typical income tax, national insurance and council tax deductions.

All incomes are inflation-adjusted to reflect their real value relative to the current year.
