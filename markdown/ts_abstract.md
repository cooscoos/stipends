The graph below shows a time series, over the last decade, of the net annual income from:

- National Living Wage (NLW) work;
- Real Living Wage (RLW) work, and;
- UKRI's minimum PhD stipend;

after typical income tax, national insurance and council tax deductions.

All incomes are inflation-adjusted to reflect their real value relative to 2023. For reference, [typical graduate salaries in 2023](https://www.graduate-jobs.com/gco/Booklet/graduate-salary-salaries.jsp) are around £30k gross (£22k net after council tax).
