The tabs below show charts and maps of the typical annual net income of PhD students around Western and Northern Europe. Tabs show:

- a bar chart (tab 1) and heat map (tab 2) showing what the UK PhD stipend would need to be to match typical PhD incomes in other countries (this accounts for local taxes and variations in the cost of living);
- a heat map of the absolute net income of PhD students around Europe (tab 3), and;
- the raw data (tab 4).

Some countries treat PhD students as salaried employees. Our analysis applies taxes to this income, but employee benefits like state pension and parental leave rights are ignored and not quantified.
